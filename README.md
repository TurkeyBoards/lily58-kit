# Turkey Lily58 Kit Keyboard
The Lily58 is a split ergonomic keyboard designed for comfort, customization, and productivity. With its 58-key column-staggered layout, the Lily58 offers a more natural typing position, reducing strain on your wrists and fingers while giving you extra keys compared to smaller 40% split boards like the Corne. This makes it a favorite for those who want ergonomic benefits and want to keep a number row.

When designing our Lily58 Kit, we set out to keep the classic look and feel of the original open-source design while adding modern upgrades and flexibility. Our version supports both wired and wireless builds, features hot-swap compatibility, full per-key RGB lighting. and encoder support,

Key Features:

- 58-key split ergonomic layout for comfort and efficiency
- Supports wired & wireless connectivity (based on installed MCU)
- Wireless Not offered yet. We are still working on the ZMK firmware
- Pro Micro and compatible controller support
- Per-key RGB lighting
